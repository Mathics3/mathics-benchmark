# The goal here is to understand the time difference between
# "ExampleFunction[var_?Type]" versus
# "ExampleFunction[var_Type]" when this appears in Python Builtin code.
#
# Commit fe6b5dc3756f52a0bca003d59138a4ceb5b73848 is an
# example that does just this.
# Commit is a commit 7716c432c8cbd3dc5ae56e3a78259dde1780781f that
# appears before this.
#
# Note that in this benchmark we want to try to pick functions that
# run reasonably quickly so we can detect that behavior of _Type vs
# _?Type which can be small compared to the cost of time-consuming
# functions. So we need to be selective thin the SHAs given above.

# Default number of iterations
iterations: 500

    comment: "Older Mathics uses var_?Type instead of better var_Type"
    exprs:
      # _StringQ
      - 'Environment["HOME"]'
      - 'Environment["I bet this does not exist"]'
      - 'SplitBy[{2, 1, 1.2}, Round]'
      # _ListQ
      - 'ContainsOnly[{}, {a, b, c}]'
      - 'ContainsOnly[{b, a, d}, {a, b, c}]'
